# Sign Language Generator

This project implements a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) for generating images from random noise vectors. The model comprises a generator that creates images and a discriminator that tries to distinguish between real images and those generated by the generator. The generator aims to fool the discriminator by producing increasingly realistic images.


## Dataset

The dataset consisting of images for various Sign Language Gestures is obtained from the following [repository](https://github.com/ardamavi/Sign-Language-Digits-Dataset).
    
## Working

#### Generator
The Generator network starts with a random noise vector of size 100, which is progressively transformed through a series of convolutional layers to produce a synthetic image. The final output is an image with the same dimensions as the input image.

#### Discriminator
The Discriminator network is a binary classifier that takes an image as input (either real or generated) and classifies an image as real or fake. It is trained to correctly classify real images as real and generated images as fake.


## Result

The original images are as follows.
